    "text": "Overview\nThe World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) invites multidisciplinary teams to participate in an international datathon on animal health data science, focusing on surveillance, risk, trade and impact assessment.\nParticipants will work remotely over several months to address real‑world analytical challenges using pilot datasets provided by WOAH and partners. The datathon aims to stimulate innovation, methodological rigor and decision‑relevant analytics in animal health.\nWinning teams will receive prize money, the opportunity to be featured in the Animal Echo and to present their work at a dedicated side event during the WOAH Global Session in 2027."
